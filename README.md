# SLM Experiment Log Book

Log of all pending and completed experiments run using the [SLM Lab](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab)

## Usage

1. Each experiment should have its own experiment page which should follow the [experiment template](TEMPLATE.md) format.
2. A new experiment page should be added to the bottom of the experiments section of the book.
3. Each pending experiment should named with an informative prefix and a link to the experiment page placed in the [experiment queue](QUEUE.md).
  - The order of experiments in the list should reflect their priority. Experiments can then be easily scheduled by running through the list in order.
4. When an experiment is finished, the experiment page should be updated with the main findings. It should be dated and archived by removing it from the experiment queue and adding a link to the page in the [completed list](COMPLETED.md)
