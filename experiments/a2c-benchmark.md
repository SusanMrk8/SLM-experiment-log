# Advantage Actor Critic Benchmark

[Originally proposed by Mnih et. al. in 2016 as A3C](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783), A2C is the synchronous version of A3C (the extra "A" in A3C stands for "Asynchronous".

A2C is an extension of AC; the extra "A" stands for the Advantage function. We use GAE to compute for the loss; apart from that, the code is shared.
