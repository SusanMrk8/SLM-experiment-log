# Advantage Actor Critic Benchmark

A2C is an extension of AC, with the additional "A" being the Advantage function. We use GAE to compute for the loss; apart from that, the code is shared.

A2C is the synchronous version of A3C, which was [originally proposed here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783).
